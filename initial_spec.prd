:dart: YOUR BEST FOOD CHOICE
  Hearty Garlic Corn Chowder (Gold - Pure Stamina)
  - +5395 Max Stamina
  - This will bring you to ~29,861 Stamina (way higher than magicka)
  :bar_chart: Why Stamina Food is Best for You
  Current Stats (unbuffed):
  - Health: 18,678
  - Magicka: 14,560
  - Stamina: 24,466 ← Your highest pool
  With Stamina Food:
  - Stamina: 29,861 (your primary stat)
  - Pragmatic Fatecarver (35% of your damage) scales with this
  - Tide King's Gaze (6% of damage) - stamina spammable benefits
  - Stampede (4.3%) - costs stamina
  - Solar Barrage (3.2%) - costs stamina
  - Barbed Trap (3.0%) - costs stamina
  With Magicka Food Instead:
  - Magicka: 19,955 (still lower than your current stamina of 24,466)
  - Fatecarver would STILL scale with stamina (because 24,466 > 19,955)
  - You'd waste the magicka bonus!
  :test_tube: POTIONS
  Still use Essence of Heroism for max parse DPS:
  - +106 Ultimate per use
  - More Shooting Star casts
  - Restores both magicka and stamina for sustain
  :clipboard: Final Shopping List
  For Maximum Parse DPS:
  1. Hearty Garlic Corn Chowder (Gold) - Pure stamina food
  2. Essence of Heroism (Gold) - Ultimate generation potions
  This setup maximizes your Fatecarver damage (which scales with stamina since that's your higher pool) AND
  sustains your stamina spammables!
